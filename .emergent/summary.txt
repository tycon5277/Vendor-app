<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially reported critical mobile app failures, including a  on the orders screen and a crash related to . Over the course of the session, they requested several fixes and features: redesigning the order notification and details page, fixing a , and implementing a comprehensive demo order generation feature. This demo feature was fully built, allowing the creation of an order and simulation of the entire delivery process.

However, after its completion, the user requested a migration away from the deprecated  package. Once that was done, the user's final request was to **remove the entire demo order flow feature** that had just been built.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  Remove the Test Order Flow button and all associated backend logic.
2.  Remove the Simulate Genie Actions feature from the order details page and its backend endpoint.
3.  Ensure the core application remains functional after the removal.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a React Native (Expo) mobile application for vendors with a FastAPI backend. The initial bugs and UI issues have been resolved. A feature to generate and simulate a full demo order lifecycle was implemented and then subsequently targeted for removal per the user's latest request. The project has also been cleaned of deprecated dependencies like  and .

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user has just requested the removal of the entire demo order flow feature from both the frontend and backend. The agent has acknowledged this request.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Both frontend and backend testing agents should be used after the removal to ensure no broken references or functionality regressions have been introduced.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending issues. The last user request is a new task.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1:** Remove the Demo Order Flow feature (Priority: P0)

#### Task Detail:
-   **Task 1: Remove the Demo Order Flow feature.**
    -   **Where to resume:** The task involves removing code from multiple files:
        1.  **Backend ():** Delete the  and  endpoints.
        2.  **Backend ():** Delete the  function.
        3.  **Frontend ():** Delete the Test Order Flow button and its handler.
        4.  **Frontend ():** Delete the Simulate Genie Actions UI and its associated handler logic.
        5.  **Frontend ():** Delete the  and  functions.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The codebase will be cleaned of the temporary demo feature as requested by the user, simplifying the application.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
    -   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no other upcoming or future tasks mentioned by the user at this time.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Demo Order Flow Bug Fix:** Fixed the initial bug where demo orders were inserted into the wrong MongoDB collection ( instead of ).
-   **Full Demo Order Flow Implementation:** Built a feature to simulate the entire order lifecycle. This included backend endpoints and a frontend UI to create a demo order, assign a genie, and step through delivery statuses (, , ). This entire feature is now slated for removal.
-   ** Deprecation Fix:** Successfully migrated the application away from the deprecated  package by removing its unused imports and deleting it from , resolving the associated console warnings.
-   ** Cleanup:** Removed the unused  package from the project dependencies.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frameworks:** React Native (Frontend) with Expo, FastAPI (Backend).
-   **Database:** MongoDB.
-   **Dependency Management:** The session involved identifying and removing unused/deprecated dependencies (, ) from  and cleaning up related code.
-   **Feature Lifecycle:** A feature was requested, fully implemented, and then requested for removal, demonstrating a complete development and rollback cycle.

**key DB schema**
-   **shop_orders:** Stores all order information, including , , , , and . This is the primary collection for orders.
-   **agent_profiles:** Stores data for delivery agents like Rajan.

**changes in tech stack**
-   The  and  packages were removed from the frontend dependencies.

**All files of reference**
-   : Will be modified to remove demo endpoints.
-   : Will be modified to remove the demo order creation function.
-   : Will be modified to remove the demo button.
-   : Will be modified to remove the genie simulation UI.
-   : Will be modified to remove API functions for demo features.
-   : Was modified to remove  and .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
None. The next task is code removal, not refactoring.

**key api endpoints**
-   : **TO BE REMOVED.**
-   : **TO BE REMOVED.**
-   : Core functionality for assigning a delivery.
-   : Core functionality for fetching orders.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate and only task is to **completely remove the demo order flow feature**. The user has explicitly requested this cleanup after it was fully built.
-   The removal spans both the frontend and backend. Refer to the In progress Task List for a precise checklist of files and components to delete.
-   After removing the code, it is critical to run comprehensive tests on both the frontend and backend to ensure that the core functionality (viewing orders, assigning real deliveries) has not been broken.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-    was updated.
-    was generated during the testing of the feature that is now being removed.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.   - **PENDING**. This is the current and highest priority task to start working on.
2.   - Agent completing the  migration.
3.   - Agent confirming the fix for the warning.
4.   - User giving approval to proceed with the  migration immediately.
5.   - User asking for clarification on a deprecation warning, which initiated the migration task.
6.   - User reporting the incomplete demo flow, which led to the implementation of the full genie simulation feature (that is now to be removed).

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** No features are currently broken.
-   **Mocked:** The demo/mock data flow is present but is scheduled for immediate removal.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Expo:** A framework and platform for universal React applications. No user-provided keys are required.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES (for the feature that is now being removed).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO

-   **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
Login is handled via OTP. No static credentials are required.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent successfully followed all user instructions, including building out a feature and then starting the process to remove it upon a change in user requirements. Nothing was forgotten.</analysis>
